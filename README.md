### ABSTRACT
This paper presents an expert system designed to analyze player statistics in La Liga, focusing on age and minutes played. The system utilizes data downloaded from FBref, specifically the age and minutes played columns of the first 15 observations. Through a combination of rules and an inference engine, the system categorizes players into different performance levels based on their age and playing time. The implementation is demonstrated with Python programming language.
